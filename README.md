# Eye-Gaze-tracking-for-virtual-keyboard

## Overview 
The “Gaze controlled keyboard” is a project where we will control the keyboard through our eyes.The goal of such technology is to write without using the hands. 


## Motivation 
To implement the technology for helping disabled people is the motivation for this project.                                                                                         
Many disabled people suffer from mutism, paralysis, loss of limb (amputees) and elders who have suffered a stroke, as a result, have lost muscle movement, and they all have a very limited scope of controlling computer devices and other technologies. But the movement of the human eye (blinking, rotating) is possible among all groups of people.                                                                                      
This work will also help patients who have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 or any other contagious disease to type text without actually touching the keyboard which helps in preventing the spread of the disease; which poses as an imperative requirement in the current status quo.

My main aim is to provide a provision through which the affected demographic who cannot type text using fingers can perform commands and deliver their message to the devices by simply moving their eyes to perform the required commands.


## Core-Logic
This project is built in 2 main parts.
  * Eye detection: detection of the eyes, their movement and most important their blinking.
  * Virtual keyboard: a keyboard on the screen where we are going to select the letters by just using our eyes. The keyboard is divided into 2 parts keeping time complexity in                           mind.
